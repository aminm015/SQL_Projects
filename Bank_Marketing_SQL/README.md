# Bank Marketing SQL 📊🏦

Hey there! Welcome to the Bank Marketing SQL project.

## 🏦 What’s This About?

This project uses the famous “Bank Marketing” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
All the data lives in a single table called `bank_data`, which covers:

- **Demographics:** age, job, marital status, education
- **Loans:** housing and personal loan info
- **Marketing campaigns:** contact type, month, duration, number of contacts
- **Previous campaign results**
- **Target variable:** Did the client subscribe to a term deposit? (`y` column)

## 🛠️ What Can You Do With These Queries?

The provided SQL scripts (in `sql_bank_queries`) help you answer questions like:

- Who has a housing loan? (Get their age and job)
- Which jobs and marital statuses were contacted in May?
- Who didn’t subscribe to a term deposit?
- What’s each client’s contact duration and campaign outcome?

- Who’s married and has a university degree?
- What’s the average age by marital status?
