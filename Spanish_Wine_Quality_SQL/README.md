## 🍇 What’s This All About?

This project is built around a dataset of about 7,500 Spanish red wines (from `wines_SPA.csv`). The data was gathered by scraping lots of wine sites, so you’ll find all kinds of bottles here!

To get started, just load the data into a table called `spanish_wines` and you’re set!
