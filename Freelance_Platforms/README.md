# SQL Project: Mini Freelance Platform 💻✨

Hey there! Welcome to my mini freelance platform database project.  
If you’ve ever wondered how sites like Upwork or Fiverr connect clients and freelancers behind the scenes—this is a simple, hands-on example built with SQL!

## 🚀 What’s This All About?

This project is a fun way to learn how a freelance platform could work on the database side.  
You’ll see how tables for clients, freelancers, gigs, proposals, contracts, and reviews all fit together.

## 📦 What’s Inside?

There are three main SQL files (run them in this order!):

1. **Create Tables.sql** – Sets up the structure for clients, freelancers, gigs, and more.  
2. **Insert Values.sql** – Fills the tables with sample data (so you have something to play with).
3. **Queries.sql** – A bunch of example queries to help you explore the database and answer questions like:
   - Which freelancers have the highest ratings?
   - What are the most expensive gigs?
   - Which clients have posted the most jobs?
   - How many proposals did a certain gig get?

## 🛠️ How To Use

1. **Set up your database:**  
   Open your favorite SQL tool and create a new, empty database.

2. **Build the tables:**  
   Run everything in `Create Tables.sql` to set up the structure.

3. **Add some data:**  
   Run everything in `Insert Values.sql` to fill the tables with sample info.

4. **Start exploring!**  
   Open `Queries.sql` and try out the example SELECT queries—or make your own!
